# BST


## Complete BST  
A complete binary tree is one where every layer except possibly the last is completely filled in.   
An AVL tree is one where every node's children are AVL trees whose heights differ by at most one.  


## AVL Tree
Binary Search Tree (BST) where the difference between heights of left and right subtrees cannot   
be more than one for all nodes.

**Every complete binary tree is an AVl tree, but not necessarily the other way around. **
